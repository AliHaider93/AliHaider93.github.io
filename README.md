 **BRL-CAD GSoC project**

# GSoC project report: 
This page contains a report of my GSoC project "Implementation of a g-k converter and Improvements to the existing k-g converter" with a summury of the project and its outcomes. 
## Project summary: 
The goal of the project is to creat a converter from LS-DYNA .k files to BRL-CAD .g files, and vice versa. The ability to convert BRL-CAD database files to other formats is an important feature, especially being able to convert the BRL-CAD geometry into a format that a well-known finite-element solver like LS-DAYNA can read, this will allow the users to run a physical/ structural analysis using a geometry on which they invested a non-trivial amount of time creating in BRL-CAD.
